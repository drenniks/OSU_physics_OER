	<title>Static Friction</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The maximum magnitude of any <term>static friction</term> force is related to the corresponding normal force<m>|\vec{F}^{sf}_{12}| \leq |\mu_s \vec{F}^{N}_{12}|</m>.  The static friction will act in a direction that opposes the attempted relative motion of the objects involved.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>The model for static friction only tells you the <em>maximum</em> value of the static friction; the magnitude can take on any value up to this maximum, depending on the other forces acting on the involved objects.  The constant <m>\mu_s</m> is called the coefficient of static friction; it is a property of the substances involved in the force.</p>

			<title>Largest and Smallest</title>
			  <p>A small car might have a mass of around 1000 kg and a coefficient of static friction of about 0.9. What is the largest possible force that static friction can exert on this car? (in N)</p>
