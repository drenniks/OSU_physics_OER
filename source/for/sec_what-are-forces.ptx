  <title>What are Forces?</title>


		<p><alert>Introductory Activity:</alert> Start by writing a short (2-3 sentence) description of how you use the term <em>force</em> in your everyday life. You might want to include an example.</p>

      Simply stated, a force is something that pushes or pulls an object.  Isaac Newton originated the concept of forces, encapsulating the theory in terms of three laws, known as Newton's laws.  Force is a vector. It has a magnitude and a direction. In the simplest terms, you can think of a force as a push or a pull. An object can have more than one force acting on it. If we add up all of the forces acting on an object, we call this the net force. It can be a tricky business, since the forces can be acting in different directions. An object can have two forces acting on it and still have a net force of zero if the two forces are acting in different directions and have the same magnitude.

	<title>Force</title>
	<statement>
		<p>A <term>force</term> is an interaction between two objects (or systems) that causes those objects to experience a push or pull.  Every force is a vector that has a <em>type</em> and involves two distinct objects acting on each other.</p>
