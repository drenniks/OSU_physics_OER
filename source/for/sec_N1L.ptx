	<title>The Law of Inertia</title>
	<statement>
	An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force.
	</statement>
	</principle>
	
		<historical>
		<title>Aristotelian Motion</title>
	<p>Before Newton's Laws of Motion, a prevailing theory of motion was put forth by Aristotle: that the natural state of an object was to be at rest as close as possible to the center of the universe (which was, of course, the center of the earth), and that if an object was disturbed, it would move and then return to rest.</p>
	
	<p>In contrast, the Law of Inertia states something fundamental about the behavior of objects: that an object <alert>does not</alert> have a natural state of rest.</p>
	</historical>
	
	<p>The term inertia--more commonly referred to as <term>mass</term>--is the capacity of an object to resist any change to its motion.  The more mass something has, the more net external force it is going to take to change the object's motion.</p>

	<title>Mass</title>
	<statement>
	<p>The <term>mass</term> on an object, typically represented using <m>m</m>, is the capacity of that object to resist changes to its motion.</p>
	</statement>
