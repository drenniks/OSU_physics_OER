<p>Force analysis can be particularly powerful when you use it to examine interacting systems.  The steps below are very similar to what you saw in <xref ref="sec_solving-forces1"/>, but will help you account for multiple systems of interest.</p>

<p><alert>Understanding:</alert> Identify all relevant systems and draw a Free-body Diagram for each.</p>

<p><alert>Calculating:</alert> Is the acceleration of each system 0 (static or dynamic equilibrium) or not 0 (dynamics)?  In addition to the Law of Motion, use any action/reaction pairs between the interacting systems.</p>

<p><alert>Sensemaking:</alert> All the sensemaking strategies you have will work, but a new strategy called Special-case Analysis (see <xref ref="sec_special-cases"/>) can be especially useful.</p>
