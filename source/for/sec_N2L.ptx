    <p>
      Start by watching the video briefing on the Law of Motion (also commonly known as Newton's 2nd Law).

	<principle>
	<title>The Law of Motion</title>
	<statement>
	<p>The net force on an object or system is equivalent to the product of object's mass and its acceleration: <m>\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}</m>.</p>
	</statement>
	</principle>
	
	<definition>
	<title>Net force</title>
	<statement>
	<p>The net force on an object or system is equal to the (vector) sum of all forces acting on it: <m>\vec{F}_{net} = \sum_i \vec{F}_i</m>.</p>
	</statement>

			<title>Summarize What You Learned - Law of Motion</title>

		   <exercise xml:id="x_summarize-n2l">
			  <p>In the video briefing, you learned a relationship between force and acceleration. This is a Building Block (and a very important one, at that). Write a 2-3 sentence description of what this symbolic equation says in your own words.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Using what you learned in the video, how would you write the units of a force (Newtons) in terms of other units you are familiar with? </p>
			</exercise>

			<exercise xml:id="x_forces-driver">
			<title>Net Force on a Driver</title>
			  <p>A carâ€™s maximum acceleration is about 6 m/s<m>^2</m>.  If the mass of the driver is about 80 kg, what is the magnitude of the net force exerted on the driver (in Newtons)?</p>
			</exercise>
				<exercise  xml:id="x_three-cars">
				<title>Three Cars</title>
			  <p>Consider the following three situations: </p>
				<ol marker="A">
				<li>You are in a car when the speed limit changes from 35 mph to 45 mph.</li>
				<li>You are in a car on the freeway driving at a constant speed of 70 mph.</li>
				<li>You are in a car waiting for a red light to turn green.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Rank the three situations by the magnitude of the net force on the car from largest to smallest.  Explain your reasoning.</p>
