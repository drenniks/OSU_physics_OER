  <title>The Elastic Force (Springs)</title>
		<exercises>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Play with this spring simulation: <url href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/masses-and-springs-basics/latest/masses-and-springs-basics_en.html"/>.  Play around with it for at least a few minutes.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>With the simulation from the previous question, investigate how the spring force appears to be related to the displacement of the spring.</p>
			<solution>
			  <p>A model for describing the force that a spring exerts on something is to treat the force as linearly proportional to the displacement, which can be written <m>F^{elastic} = -k(x_f - x_i)</m>.</p>
				</solution>

			  <p>Explain how the expression in the solution to the previous exercise is consistent with your observations from the simulation (cite a specific observation!).</p>
