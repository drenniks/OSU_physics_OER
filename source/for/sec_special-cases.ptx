	<statement>
		<p><term>Special-case Analysis</term> allows you to make sense of a symbolic equation in physics.  The objective is to choose a case that is <em>special</em> because the answer is obvious or the context becomes straightforward and check to see if your equation matches your intuition.</p>
	</statement>

<p>When you use Special-case Analysis, continue to follow the sensemaking steps you saw in <xref ref="fig_sensemaking"/>.  In particular, the chart below can help you keep track of how to use these sensemaking steps when you are using Special-case Analysis.</p>

			  <p>When you are making sense of something in physics, it can be tempting to just say "`Yes, this makes sense to me."'  Why do you think you should say more when sensemaking?</p>
