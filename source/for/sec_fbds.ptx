			<title>Free-body Diagram</title>
			<statement>
					<!-- From Kathy's website -->
	<p>
	A <term>free body diagram</term> is a pictorial way to represent the forces acting on an object.  In a <term>free-body diagram</term>, each force should be labeled using the following symbol <m>\vec{F}_{BC}^A</m>, where <m>\vec{F}</m> indicates that the symbol represents a force, the superscript <m>A</m> represents the type of force (for example, <m>G</m> for gravity), <m>B</m> represents the object (or system) on which the force is acted, and <m>C</m> represents the object (or system) that is exerting the force.</p>
			</statement>
		</lemma>
		
		<p>One of the most important things to understand when drawing free-body diagrams is the difference between forces acting <em>on</em> an object (which appear on that object's free-body diagram) and forces acted <em>nby</em> an object, which would instead be represented on the free-body diagram for the other object.  It is also important <em>not</em> to include things that are not forces, such as the velocity or acceleration of the object, which would instead be represented using a motion diagram.  It is also helpful to include the force vectors acting on an object with relatively correct lengths as well as coordinate axes and any relevant angles.</p>

    <p>
      Choose an instant in the video of Dr. Paws from <xref ref="for_ball"/> and draw a free-body diagram for the dog using what you learned in the video briefing.

		The free-body diagram is one of the representational tools we will use most often throughout physics.  Why do <em>you</em> think it might be such a valuable too?  What features of the free body diagram do you think might be most helpful when you are solving future problems?
