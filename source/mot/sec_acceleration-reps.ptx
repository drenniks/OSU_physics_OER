  <title>Representing Acceleration</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The motion diagram below shows a ball moving from left to right.  A total of 1 s has passed between each successive dot.

			<p>Recall <xref ref="mot_MotionA"></xref>.</p>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Complete the motion diagram for the ball at the beginning of this activity by sketching velocity and acceleration vectors at each point.  (Your vectors should be at qualitatively accurate!  That is, vectors with larger magnitudes should have greater length.)</p>
				<p>{I have a solution video with motion diagrams and a graph of position vs time if we want to include it here.}</p>
