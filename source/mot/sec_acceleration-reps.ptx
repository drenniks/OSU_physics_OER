  <title>Representing Acceleration</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In previous sections, we defined two important motion representations: <term>motion diagrams</term> and <term>motion graphs</term>.  Either of these representations can feature acceleration as well as velocity and position.
    </p>
  </introduction>
	
	<p>A motion graph for acceleration is straightforward: simply graph acceleration on the vertical axis vs. time on the horizontal axis!</p>
	
	<p>A motion diagram can be extended to include acceleration by sketching and labeling acceleration vectors for each point.</p>

			<exercise xml:id="x_practice-rep-acc">
			<statement>
			  <p>Complete the motion diagram for the ball by sketching velocity and acceleration vectors at each point.  (Your vectors should be at qualitatively accurate!  That is, vectors with larger magnitudes should have greater length.)</p>
			</statement>
