			<title>Real-world Context - Throwing a Ball</title>
			<statement>
			<p>You throw a ball that flies through the air and eventually lands some distance away from you.  Find the initial velocity and speed with which you threw the ball.</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
			<p>Remember to follow the full set of steps from <xref ref="fig_realworld"/>.  What numbers do you need to estimate for this problem?</p>
			</hint>

		</solution>
			</exercise>
			
			<p>You throw three marbles off the same table, each with the same initial speed but a different initial direction, as shown in the figure below.  The floor in front of the marbles is flat.</p>
