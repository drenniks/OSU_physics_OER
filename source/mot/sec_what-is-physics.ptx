	<p>Physics is ...</p>
	
	<p>In physics, you will use many everyday words that have extremely precise meanings.  For example, you will often consider a physics <term>context</term>, which in general describes a situation, usually with some connection to the real world.  Within a context, you might decide to focus on one or more <term>systems</term>: a system might then have one or more objects in it.  As you consider the context, you may decide to make <term>assumptions</term> or <term>idealizations</term>, make graphs or diagrams, write laws and equations, solve for one or more quantities, estimate or plug in numbers, and perform physics <term>sensemaking</term>.</p>

			<description>1. Understand and plan.  1a. Understand the problem – identify quantities by symbol and number.  1b. Identify Assumptions – identify importan simplifications and assumptions.  1c. Represent physically – draw and label one or more appropriate diagrams and/or graphs that might help you solve the problem.</description></image>

			<description>2. Calculating an Unknown Quantity.  2a. Represent principles – identify relevant concepts, laws, or definitions.  2b. Find unknown(s) symbolically – without numbers, find any unknown(s) in terms of symbols representing known quantities.  2c. Plug in numbers – plug numbers (with units) into your symbolic answer! </description></image>
