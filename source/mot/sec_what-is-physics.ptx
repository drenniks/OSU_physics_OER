	<p>Physics is ...</p>
	
	<p>In physics, you will use many everyday words that have extremely precise meanings.  For example, you will often consider a physics <term>context</term>, which in general describes a situation, usually with some connection to the real world.  Within a context, you might decide to focus on one or more <term>systems</term>: a system might then have one or more objects in it.  As you consider the context, you may decide to make <term>assumptions</term> or <term>idealizations</term>, make graphs or diagrams, write laws and equations, solve for one or more quantities, estimate or plug in numbers, and perform physics <term>sensemaking</term>.</p>

			<description>Explanations in Physics.  1. Principles – what fundamental physics concepts, laws, or definitions did you start with?  2. Reasoning – explain all the reasoning steps to go from your starting point to your conclusion.  3. Conclusion – state your conclusion clearly.</description></image>

			<description>Calculating an Unknown Quantity.  1. Represent principles – identify relevant concepts, laws, or definitions.  2. Find unknown(s) symbolically – without numbers, find any unknown(s) in terms of symbols representing known quantities.  3. Plug in numbers – plug numbers (with units) into your symbolic answer! </description></image>

			<description>Assumptions and Idealizations. 1 Is the assumption useful for the context?  2 Is the assumption reasonable for the context?  3 Are there any limitations for the context?</description></image>

			<description>Physics Sensemaking.  1. Choose a sensemaking strategy.  2a. What should this strategy say about the context?  2b. Give a physical reason for why it says this.  3a. What does your answer actually say?  3b. Show what it says explicitly. 4. Compare what your answer actually says and what it should say!</description></image>
