  <title>What is Motion?</title>
  <introduction>
<p>
We use the term <em>motion</em> to refer to the motion of one or more objects through space.</p>

<p>The study of the motion of objects comprises a field of physics called mechanics.  Mechanics is an expansive field that includes many related ideas, including forces, energy, and momentum.  We divide mechanics into two branches.  First, we will study <alert>how</alert> objects move through space (this is sometimes known as kinematics, but we will typically just use the word motion).  Later, we will study <alert>why</alert> objects move (this is called dynamics).</p>
