  <title>What is Motion?</title>

	<p>In physics, we will use the term <em>motion</em> to refer to the movement of one or more objects through space.  When you are done with the activity above, click on Solution to see additional information about motion in physics.</p>
	
	<p>The study of the motion of objects comprises a field of physics called mechanics.  Mechanics is an expansive field that includes many related ideas, including forces, energy, and momentum.  We divide mechanics into two branches.  First, we will study <alert>how</alert> objects move through space (this is sometimes known as kinematics, but we will typically just use the word motion).  Later, we will study <alert>why</alert> objects move (this is called dynamics).</p>

									<title>Explore What You Already Know about Motion</title>
						<statement>
							<p>Find a blank sheet of paper and make a list of everything you know about motion.  Your list can include anything you want: words, symbols, equations, pictures, experiences, questions, <em>etc.</em>  Try to base what you write as much on your everyday personal experience as on any previous formal instruction on motion.</p>
