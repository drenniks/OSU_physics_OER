  <title>The Particle Model</title>
  <introduction>
 <p>
The motion of real objects is often extremely complicated.  For example, when you toss a coin, it will likely rotate so that different parts of the coin move at different speeds, and in different directions. 
</p>

<p>
To begin to investigate motion, we will make a <em>simplifying assumption</em> that an object in motion can be treated as a <alert>particle</alert>.  When we make this assumption, we say that we are using the particle model because we are <em>modeling</em> the motion of an object as if it were a <em>particle</em>.
</p>

<proposition>
	<title>The Particle Model</title>
	<statement>
		<p>When you assume that an object or system can be treated as a <term>point particle</term>, you treat it as if it has no physical extent and that it can only undergo <alert>translational motion</alert> (motion without rotation).</p>
	</statement>
</proposition>

<p>
Whenever we decide whether or not to make an assumption, consider two question: (1) is the assumption useful for our situation and (2) is the assumption reasonable for our situation?  The particle model is almost always useful because it is extremely simple (like many of the assumptions we will make).  However, by assuming an object is a particle, we are neglecting information about its size, extent, and rotation.  The particle model is most reasonable when these properties <em>do not have a substantial impact</em> on its translational motion.  Once we have a firm understanding of translational motion, we can amend our model to include other kinds of motion.  Within the particle model, we will start by considering motion along a straight-line path (one-dimensional translational motion) before describing translational motion in two- or even three-dimensions.
