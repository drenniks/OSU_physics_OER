  <title>The Particle Model</title>
  <introduction>
 <p>
The motion of real objects is often extremely complicated.  For example, when you toss a coin, it will likely rotate so that different parts of the coin move at different speeds, and in different directions. 
</p>

<p>
To begin to investigate motion, we will make a <em>simplifying assumption</em> that an object in motion can be treated as a <alert>particle</alert>.  When we make this assumption, we say that we are using the particle model because we are <em>modeling</em> the motion of an object as if it were a <em>particle</em>.
</p>

<proposition>
	<title>The Particle Model</title>
	<statement>
		<p>When you assume that an object or system can be treated as a <term>point particle</term>, you treat it as if it has no physical extent and that it can only undergo <alert>translational motion</alert> (motion without rotation).</p>
	</statement>
</proposition>

<p>
Whenever we decide whether or not to make an assumption, consider two questions: 
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Is the assumption useful for our situation </li>
<li>Is the assumption reasonable for our situation? </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The particle model is almost always useful because it is extremely simple (like many of the assumptions we will make).  However, by assuming an object is a particle, we are neglecting information about its size, extent, and rotation.  The particle model is most reasonable when these properties <em>do not have a substantial impact</em> on its translational motion.  Once we have a firm understanding of translational motion, we can amend our model to include other kinds of motion.  Within the particle model, we will start by considering motion along a straight-line path (one-dimensional translational motion) before describing translational motion in two- or even three-dimensions.
