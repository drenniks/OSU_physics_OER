  <title>The Particle Model</title>
  <introduction>
 <p>
The motion of real objects is often extremely complicated.  For example, when you toss a coin, it will likely rotate so that different parts of the coin move at different speeds, and in different directions. 
</p>

<p>
To begin to investigate motion, we will make a <em>simplifying assumption</em> that an object in motion can be treated as a <alert>particle</alert>.  When we make this assumption, we say that we are using the particle model because we are <em>modeling</em> the motion of an object as if it were a <em>particle</em>.
</p>

<assumption>
	<title>The Particle Model</title>
	<statement>
		<p>When you assume that a system can be treated as a <term>point particle</term>, you treat it as only undergoing <alert>translational motion</alert> (motion without rotation).  Under this assumption, you treat all the mass of the system as existing at the object's center of mass<fn>center of mass is a property we will not need until we begin studying rotational motion</fn>.</p>
	</statement>
</assumption>

<aside>
<title>When does an assumption fail?</title>
<p>
When you encounter a new assumption, you might want to consider not just when it is good to make the assumption, but instead when the assumption might fail.  As an assumption, the particle model tends to fail when there is (important) rotational motion or when your system has multiple pieces that are moving differently.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
Whenever we decide whether or not to make an assumption, consider two questions: 
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Is the assumption useful for our situation? </li>
<li>Is the assumption reasonable for our situation? </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The particle model is almost always useful because it is extremely simple (like many of the assumptions we will make).  However, by assuming an object is a particle, we are neglecting information about its size, extent, and rotation.  The particle model is most reasonable when these properties <em>do not have a substantial impact</em> on its translational motion.  Once we have a firm understanding of translational motion, we can amend our model to include other kinds of motion.  Within the particle model, we will start by considering motion along a straight-line path (one-dimensional translational motion) before describing translational motion in two- or even three-dimensions.
