	<title>Position</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>position</term> of an object describes the location of that object relative to some origin as a vector quantity.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>In general, position is three-dimensional, but for now, we will stick to two dimensions.  As with any vector, position can be written either by giving a magnitude and a direction, or by writing it in terms of components: <m>\vec{r}= r_x\hat{x} + r_y \hat{y}</m>.  A graphical representation of such a vector is shown below.</p>

	<title>Displacement</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>displacement</term> of an object describes the change in that object's position: <m>\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_i</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>
	
	<p>Suppose an object is initially located at position <m>\vec{r}_0</m> at some initial time <m>t_0</m> and the object is moving through space over an interval of time <m>\Delta t = t_f - t_0</m>. The symbol <m>\Delta</m> (the capital Greek letter "Delta") represents a change in a quantity.  The time interval <m>\Delta t</m> measures the elapsed time as the object moves from an initial position <m>\vec{r}_0</m>  at initial time <m>t_0</m> to a final position <m>\vec{r}_0</m> and some final time <m>t_f</m>. The vector <m>\Delta \vec{r}</m> is called the displacement of the object over the time interval <m>\Delta t</m>.  Here, we have used the subscript 0 to refer to some initial time: in some cases, we will instead use the subscript <m>o</m> ("naught") or the subscript <m>i</m> (for "initial") instead of 0.</p>

			<exercise>
			  <p>We defined a large number of quantities in this section.  Make a list of all the different quantities we used and write yourself a brief description along with the symbol(s) we used for each quantity.  In particular, note which quantities are <em>vectors</em> and which quantities are <em>scalars</em>.</p>

			<title>Vectors in the Park</title>
			<introduction>
			<p>You and your friend are each standing at opposite ends of a 125 m long park.  Your friend, who is initially due south of you, walks 50 m east and stops to wait for you.  Then, you walk in a straight line until you reach your friend.</p>

			  <p>Reflect on your choice of origin for this problem.  What impact did your choice have on how you solved it?  Could you have made a different choice?</p>
