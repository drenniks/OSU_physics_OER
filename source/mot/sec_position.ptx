	<title>Position</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>position</term> of an object describes the location of that object relative to some origin as a vector quantity.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>As described above, a position vector is always measured relative to some <term>origin</term> (a fixed location in space) and using some set of <term>coordinates</term>.  In general, position is three-dimensional, but for now, we will stick to two dimensions.  As with any vector, position can be written either by giving a magnitude and a direction, or by writing it in terms of components: <m>\vec{r}= r_x\hat{x} + r_y \hat{y}</m>.  A graphical representation of such a vector is shown below.</p>

<title>Coordinates</title>
<p>
You will start by using the Cartesian coordinates that are probably familiar from math: <m>x</m> along the horizontal axis and <m>y</m> along the vertical axis (plus <m>z</m> if you need it!).  Although these coordinates are familiar, they are also arbitrary, and you will soon find that physics likes to use other coordinates when it is convenient for a situation.  This may mean rotating the Cartesian coordinates so they are tilted, using different coordinates for two different objects in the same situation, or even using non-Cartesian coordinates such as circular (polar) coordinates.

	<title>Displacement</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>displacement</term> of an object describes the change in that object's position: <m>\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_i</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>
	
	<p>Suppose an object is initially located at position <m>\vec{r}_0</m> at some initial time <m>t_0</m> and the object is moving through space over an interval of time <m>\Delta t = t_f - t_0</m>. The symbol <m>\Delta</m> (the capital Greek letter "Delta") represents a change in a quantity.  The time interval <m>\Delta t</m> measures the elapsed time as the object moves from an initial position <m>\vec{r}_0</m>  at initial time <m>t_0</m> to a final position <m>\vec{r}_0</m> and some final time <m>t_f</m>. The vector <m>\Delta \vec{r}</m> is called the displacement of the object over the time interval <m>\Delta t</m>.  Here, we have used the subscript 0 to refer to some initial time: in some cases, we will instead use the subscript <m>o</m> ("naught") or the subscript <m>i</m> (for "initial") instead of 0.</p>

<title>Subscripts</title>
<p>
You have probably noticed that physics notation uses subscripts to mean a lot of different things!  In general, physics symbols try to be descriptive, choosing evocative letters like <m>m</m> for mass and <m>t</m> for time.  Physics symbols also try to be specific (<m>m_1</m> for the mass of object 1, <m>m_2</m> for the mass of object 2, <em>etc.</em>) and detailed (<m>t_i</m> for the initial time and <m>t_f</m> for the final time).  Sometimes, subcripts might even be combined: <m>r_{x3i}</m> for the <m>x</m>-component of object 3's initial position.  As you practice, you will start to get a sense for all the different things you can use a subscript for.

			<title>Summarize What You Learned - Position</title>
			  <p>We defined a large number of quantities in this section.  Make a list of all the different quantities we used and write yourself a brief description along with the symbol(s) we used for each quantity.  In particular, note which quantities are <em>vectors</em> and which quantities are <em>scalars</em>.</p>

			<title>Vectors in the Park</title>
			<p>You and your friend are each standing at opposite ends of a 125 m long park.  Your friend, who is initially due south of you, walks 50 m east and stops to wait for you.  Then, you walk in a straight line until you reach your friend.
