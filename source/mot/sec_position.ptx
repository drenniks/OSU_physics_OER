	<statement>
		<p>The <term>position</term> of an object describes the location of that object relative to some origin as a vector quantity.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>In general, position is three-dimensional, but for now, we will stick to two dimensions.  As with any vector, position can be written either by giving a magnitude and a direction, or by writing it in terms of components: <m>\vec{r}= r_x\hat{x} + r_y \hat{y}</m>.  A graphical representation of such a vector is shown below.</p>

<p>{We need to add in the actual figure!}</p>
