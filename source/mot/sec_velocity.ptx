	<title>Average Velocity</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>average velocity</term> of an object is the object's displacement divided by the interval of time required to move through that displacement: <m>\vec{v}_{ave} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<title>Time</title>
<p>
Time is a quantity you will encounter throughout your study of physics.  In fact, most of physics is concerned with predicting what will happen to a system at some future or time, or looking back to see the status of a system at some previous time.
</p>
</aside>

<p>When speaking to a friend or colleague we may not make a distinction between <emph>speed</emph> and <emph>velocity</emph>, but in physics the words are distinct.  Where <emph>velocity</emph> is a vector, indicating both magnitude and direction, the word <emph>speed</emph> refers only to the magnitude of the velocity.</p>

<p>Physics also distinguishes between <emph>average</emph> quantities for intervals of definite time, and <emph>instantaneous</emph> quantities for infinitesimal intervals.  To signal the difference, we will use the symbol <m>d</m> for an infinitesimal quantity instead of the <m>\Delta</m> symbol that we use for a definite change.</p>

	<definition>
	<title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>instantaneous velocity</term> of an object is given by <m>\vec{v} = \frac{d \vec{r}}{d t}</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

	<title>Summarize What You Learned - Velocity</title>
	<p>With definitions like the one above, you should aim to understand each mathematical symbol in the symbolic equation, along with how those symbols work together.  You should also know the kind of quantity each symbol represents, and the units associated with that quantity.  The exercises below are intended to help you build this understanding.</p>
			<exercise xml:id="x_summarize-velocity">
			  <p>Write a 1-2 sentence description of what the definition of average velocity says in words. </p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			 <statement>
			  <p>What are the units of velocity? Explain how these units are consistent with the units of the other quantities in the definition of average velocity given above.</p>
				</statement>
				<answer>
				<p>m/s</p>
				</answer>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			<statement>
			  <p>How does the direction of the average velocity vector compare to the direction of the displacement vector?</p>
				</statement>
				<answer>
				<p>The average velocity vector points in the sameÂ direction as the displacement vector and tells us the direction of motion the object.</p>
				</answer>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>In physics we will use both the idea of velocity and the idea of speed. In everyday language, these two words are often used interchangeably, but in physics they have distinct meanings. Write 1-2 sentences aimed at explaining the difference between velocity and speed to a child.</p>
