	<title>The Rigid-body Model</title>
	<statement>
		<p>When you assume that a system can be treated as a <term>rigid body</term>, you treat it as undergoing both <alert>translational motion</alert> and <alert>rotational motion</alert>.  Under this assumption, you treat all parts of the system as moving with the same angular velocity, while the center of mass of the object is treated as moving with the translational velocity.</p>

			<title>Extended Free-body Diagram</title>
			<statement>
	<p>
	An <term>Extended Free-body Diagram</term> is a more detailed pictorial way to represent the forces acting on an object in which the object is represented as a shape and each force is shown acting at its point of contact.  As in a free-body diagram, each force should be labeled using the following symbol <m>\vec{F}_{BC}^A</m>, where <m>\vec{F}</m> indicates that the symbol represents a force, the superscript <m>A</m> represents the type of force (for example, <m>G</m> for gravity), <m>B</m> represents the system on which the force is acted, and <m>C</m> represents the system that is exerting the force.</p>
