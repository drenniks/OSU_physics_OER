  <title>Vector Operations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
     In this course we will become comfortable performing several vector operations.
    </p>
    
 <exercises>
 <title> Vector Addition</title>
 </exercises>

 <p>
Suppose we have two vectors <m> \vec{A}</m> and <m> \vec{B}</m>. To add the two vectors, we will place the tail of <m> \vec{B}</m> at the head of <m> \vec{A}</m>. The vector connecting the tail of  <m> \vec{A}</m> to the head of <m> \vec{B}</m> is the sum <m> \vec{A} + \vec{B}</m>.

 <exercises>
 <title> Vector Subtraction</title>
 </exercises>

<p>
To subtract two vectors, we can simply add the negative <m> \vec{A} + (-\vec{B})</m>. Recall that the negative vector points in the opposite direction but has the same length.

 <exercises>
 <title> Multiplication of a vector by a scalar</title>
 </exercises>

<p>
Multiplication of a vector with a positive scalar will <em>scale</em> the magnitude of the vector but leave the direction unchanged. Multiplication by a negative scalar will <em>reverse</em> the direction in addition to scaling the vector magnitude.
</p>

     <figure xml:id="vec_scalar_mult">
    	<caption>An arrow representing vector A is shown. The scalar multiplication of A by -1/2 and 2 is also shown.</caption>

 <exercises>
 <title> The dot product of two vectors</title>
 </exercises>

<p>
Vectors do not multiply in the same way as scalars due to their inherent directionality. The dot product of two vectors is itself a scalar value, <m>\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = AB sin\theta</m>.
</p>

     <figure xml:id="vec_dot_product">
    	<caption>A representation of vectors A and B and the angle between them illustrating the dot product fo tweo vectors.</caption>
    		<image source="vectors/vec_dot_product.png" width = "25%" ></image>
    </figure>
    
<p>
Here, <m> \theta</m> represents the angle between the two vectors when they are placed tail to tail. A and B represent the magnitude of the vectors <m> \vec{A}</m> and <m> \vec{B}</m>.
</p>
<p>
Conceptually, the dot product quantifies how much of one vector is in the same direction as another vector, or how parallel two vectors are. The dot product is the magnitude of <m> \vec{B}</m> multiplied by the projection of  <m> \vec{A}</m> along <m> \vec{B}</m>. We can think of a projection as the length of the shadow that <m> \vec{A}</m> would cast on <m> \vec{B}</m> if we were to shine a light from above.
</p>
<p>
Many physical quantities (work, torque, angular momentum) depend on how parallel or how perpendicular two vector quantities are with respect to each other. The underlying conceptual framework of what a dot product tells us about nature is geometric. In this class we will be exploring many situations which will require us to build our geometric reasoning skills.
