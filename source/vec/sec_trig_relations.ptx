  <title>Trigonometric Relations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
Previously, we claimed that vector analysis is an important aspect of quantifying motion that occurs in more than one physical dimension and that one useful property of vectors is that they can be broken down into components along the axes of a coordinate system using unit vectors. 
    </p>
    
 <p>
Now, recall that the sides of a right triangle can be related to the angle using the trigonometric relations
</p>

<p>
Consider the sine of angle <m> \theta</m> and its relationship to the sides of the triangle
</p>

<me>
sin \theta = \frac{opposide}{hypotenuse} = \frac{r_y}{r}
</me>	

<p>
Suppose we are given the magnitude and direction angle and we would like to find the components of the vector. We can solve the above equation for the y-component of the position vector <m> \vec{r} </m>  using the above relationship where <m> r_y = rsin\theta</m>. In this case, the y-component is the magnitude of the vector multiplied by the sine of the angle. 
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the cosine of angle <m> \theta</m> and its relationship to the sides of the triangle
</p>

<me>
cos \theta = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} = \frac{r_x}{r}
</me>	

<p>
To find the x-component of the position vector <m>\vec{r} </m> we can use the above relationship where <m> r_x = rcos\theta</m>. 
</p>

<p>
The third relationship allows us to determine the <alert>direction angle</alert> <m>\theta</m> of the position vector using its components. 
</p>

<me>
tan \theta = \frac{opposite}{adjacent} = \frac{r_y}{r_x}  \rightarrow \theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{r_y}{r_x})
</me>	

<p>
Note that vectors are intimately related to right triangle trigonometry. In fact, geometrically the magnitude (length) of a vector is simply the length of the hypotenuse which can be determined using the familiar Pythagorean theorem.
</p>

<me>
r = |\vec{r}| = \sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2}
