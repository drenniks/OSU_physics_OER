  <title>The Unit Vector</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
We will often need to orient a vector within a particular coordinate system. To do so we introduce the concept of a unit vector. A unit vector is a vector that has magnitude (length) of one. For this reason, unit vectors are often called direction vectors.
    </p>
    
 <p>
We symbolically represent unit vector with "hats." Most commonly, unit vectors are used for indicating the directions of a coordinate system. For example <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are unit vectors which point parallel to the positive x-direction, positive y-direction and positive z-direction (these are often called basis vectors in a mathematics class).
</p>

<p>
Since <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, their dot products
</p>

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{x} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{z} \cdot \hat{z} = 1
</me>	

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{x} \cdot \hat{z} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{z} = 0
</me>		

<p>
Many textbooks, and authors use different notation for the unit vectors. Often, you will see unit vectors written using <m> \hat{i} </m>, <m> \hat{j} </m> and <m> \hat{k} </m> to represent the positive x-direction, positive y-direction and positive z-direction. Both notations are equivalent, and are just a convention. Use whatever notation is more comfortable for you.
