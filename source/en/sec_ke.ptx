			<exercise>
			  <p>Write a 1-2 sentence description of what the definition of kinetic energy says in words and why it makes sense given your everyday experience. </p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>We will measure energy in Joules (J).  Use the definition of kinetic energy to write a Joule in terms of other units you are familiar with.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  			<p>Many cars have a mass that is somewhere around 1200 kg. Estimate the kinetic energy (in J) of such a car that is traveling down a highway at 70 mph.</p>
