    <p>
     One way to change the energy of an object is to do work on it.  Work is a change in energy that arises when an external force acts on an object that moves through some distance.

	<title>Exploring Work</title>

			<exercise>
			  <p>The definition of work can look pretty complicated the first time you see it!  Make a list of all the <em>symbols</em> you see in the equation.  For each symbol, write a short description of what you think that symbol means in the context of this equation.</p>

     Watch the video briefing below on work.

			<exercise>
			  <p>You are pulling a box across the floor using a horizontal rope with a tension force of 250 N.</p>
				
				<p>How much work (in J) have you done after the box has slid 3 m along the floor?</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Suppose you were to angle your rope so that it makes an angle of <m>20^o</m> with the horizontal (the magnitude of the tension is unchanged).</p>
				
				<p>How much work (in J) have you done after the box has slid 3 m along the floor?</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
				<p>Why is the work you calculated for the two situations above not the same?</p>
