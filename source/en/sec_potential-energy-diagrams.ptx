	<title>Potential Energy Diagrams</title>
	<statement>
	<p>A potential energy diagram is a graph of the potential energy <m>U(x)</m> vs. <m>x</m> for some system of interest.</p>
	</statement>
	</lemma>

<p>On a potential energy diagram, it is often useful to indicate the total energy of a system.</p>

	<title>Energy Bar Chart</title>
	<statement>
	<p>An energy bar chart is a graphical representation where each form of energy in a system is represented by a vertical bar.  It is often common to draw a different bar chart for each instant of interest.</p>
