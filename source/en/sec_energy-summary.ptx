			<title>Conservation</title>
			<p>In studying energy and momentum, you learned about conservation laws, which provide a different perspective on the world than forces do.  Summarize the conservation laws you learned about, including information about <em>when</em> each quantity is conserved. </p>
		</exercise>

			<title>Analysis</title>
   			<p>You have now learned several different ways to analyze a context: forces, energy, and momentum.  All three of them are valid, but they are not all equally useful in different situations.  Write a few sentences summarizing when and how you want to use each strategy going forward.</p>
