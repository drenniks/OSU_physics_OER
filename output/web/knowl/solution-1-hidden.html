<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">In addition to "`distance equals rate times time,"â€™ try these two assumptions: that the distance traveled is the same (both drivers take the same route) and that the drivers leave at the same time.  Since the product of speed (rate) and time must be a constant (the distance driven), the driver with the larger speed must complete the drive in the smaller time.  Your friend is the driver with the higher speed, so they must take less time, arriving before you!</div></body>
