<div class="para">Any measurement of position or velocity needs to be made with respect to a specific frame of reference. Suppose a person is walking past you at 5 km/hr toward the front of an airplane which is traveling west at 150 km/hr. The speed of 5 km/hr is with respect to the planeâ€™s frame of reference. With respect to the ground, this person is actually moving at speed (150 km/hr + 5 km/hr = 155 km/hr). Just as it is always important to specify the units of a quantity when reporting a number, it is equally important to specify the frame of reference from which you are making a measurement.</div>
