<div class="para">Energy can be transferred from one system to another when those two systems interact with each other in certain ways.  When energy is transferred from one system to another, the total energy of one system will increase and the total energy of the other system will decrease by the same amount.  The primary means of energy transfer in physics are <em class="alert">work</em> (energy transfer associated with a force) and <em class="alert">heat</em> (energy transfer associated with a difference in temperature).  If a system is not interacting with anything external (or if all external energy transfers sum to zero), you can say that the total energy of the system is <dfn class="terminology">conserved</dfn>, or constant in time.  If you were to choose a system consisting of everything in the universe, since there is nothing external to interact with the universe, you can say that the total energy in the universe should be conserved.</div>
