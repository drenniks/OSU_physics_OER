<div class="para">Before Newtonâ€™s Laws of Motion, a prevailing theory of motion was put forth by Aristotle: that the natural state of an object was to be at rest as close as possible to the center of the universe (which was, of course, the center of the Earth), and that if an object was disturbed, it would move and then return to rest.</div>
<div class="para">In contrast, the Law of Inertia states something fundamental about the behavior of objects: that an object has two possible natural states: at rest or moving in a straight line at constant speed.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_N1L.html#historical-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
