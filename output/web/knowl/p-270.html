<div class="para">One of the most important things to understand when drawing free-body diagrams is the difference between forces acting <em class="emphasis">on</em> a system (which appear on that systemâ€™s free-body diagram) and forces acted <em class="emphasis">by</em> a system, which would instead be represented on the free-body diagram for the other system.  It is also important <em class="emphasis">not</em> to include things that are not forces, such as the velocity or acceleration of the system, which would instead be represented using a motion diagram.  It is also helpful to include the force vectors acting on a system with relatively correct lengths as well as coordinate axes and any relevant angles.</div>
