<div class="para">You might be asking yourself: what would an <em class="emphasis">unreasonable</em> answer have looked like?  Perhaps your measurement had been 174 cm instead of 17.4 cm.  This is only about ten times bigger, and still seems like a reasonable measurement for a physics lab (something about the height of a person).  On the other hand, measuring something like 17.4 km would be fairly unreasonable for an ordinary physics lab: 100,000 times bigger than a personâ€™s hand!</div>
