<div class="para">Sometimes, the physics will use the word dimensions to refer to the class of unit for a quantity.  For example, speed can be measured in units of km/hr, m/s, or mi/hr but the base <em class="emphasis">dimensions</em>, represented in square brackets, are always a length [L] divided by a time [T].</div></aside> <div class="para">Suppose that we have derived the escape speed of a rocket from a planet of mass <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> and radius <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> (escape speed is the speed at which an object must reach to escape the gravitational pull): <span class="process-math">\(v_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}\text{.}\)</span>  As a speed, <span class="process-math">\(v_{esc}\)</span> should have units like m/s (distance divided by time).</div> <div class="para">Here, <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> represents the universal gravitational constant with units <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}^2\text{kg}}\text{.}\)</span> Since there is an equal sign, this implies that the base units of either side of the equal sign must be the same. If they are not, then we have made a mistake in our derivation of the escape speed. We can perform a unit analysis to determine if we have the same base units for each side of the equal sign.</div> <div class="para"><span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \stackrel{?}{=} \sqrt{\frac{\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}^2\text{kg}}\text{kg}}{\text{m}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}}=\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \checkmark\)</span></div> <div class="para">We can see that the physical quantities under the square root indeed have base units of [L] divided by a time [T] and so our equation holds true.  Observe that we followed the sensemaking steps outlined above: we chose a strategy (checking units), determined what units we <em class="emphasis">should</em> get, found the units we <em class="emphasis">actually</em> have, and compared the two to see that they are the same!</div></article></body>
