<div class="para">A mathematical object which has a both a <em class="emphasis">magnitude</em> (a size or amount) and a <em class="emphasis">direction</em> is called a <em class="alert">vector</em>.  It is essential to take into account how both the magnitude and direction of a vector quantity changes when you analyze motion. A quantity that only has a magnitude is called a <em class="alert">scalar</em>.  Suppose you have a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\)</span> . The  negative vector <span class="process-math">\(-\vec{A}\)</span>  has the same magnitude as vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\)</span> , but points in the opposite direction. Once you understand how to visually represent and perform operations on vectors, you will move on to understand how to manipulate them algebraically.</div>
