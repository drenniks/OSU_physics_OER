<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">Extended Free-body Diagram</dfn> is a more detailed pictorial way to represent the forces acting on an object in which the object is represented as a shape and each force is shown acting at its point of contact.  As in a free-body diagram, each force should be labeled using the following symbol <span class="process-math">\(\vec{F}_{BC}^A\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vec{F}\)</span> indicates that the symbol represents a force, the superscript <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> represents the type of force (for example, <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> for gravity), <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> represents the system on which the force is acted, and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> represents the system that is exerting the force.</div>
