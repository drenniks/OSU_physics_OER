<dfn class="terminology">Time:</dfn> Throughout most of history, the standard of time was based on the mean solar day. However, scientists needed a way to make incredibly high precision measurements of time and so physicists began developing a device called an atomic clock. Atomic clocks work on the principle that subatomic particles called electrons will move back and forth between different energy states when exposed to certain frequencies of radiation. The United States’ standard atomic clock is said to be so accurate that in 30 million years it would neither gain nor lose a second. One second is defined as the time it takes for 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a radio wave absorbed by the cesium-133 atom.</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Length:</dfn> One meter is the distance light can travel in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458 of a second.</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Mass:</dfn> For many years, one kilogram was the mass of a polished platinum-iridium cylinder, the international standard kilogram, which is stored in Paris, France.  Since 2019, the kilogram has been defined even more precisely using the above definitions for length and time along with a fundamental quantum mechanical property of the universe called Planck’s constant.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/Le%20Grand%20K-1.png" class="contained" alt="A small cylindrical object inside a glass container."></div>
