<body class="ignore-math"><article class="insight remark-like"> <div class="para">Suppose that you drive North for 40 miles and then head West for 30 miles. You have now driven a total of 70 miles, yet your total <em class="alert">displacement</em> is only 50 miles Northwest from where you started. Displacement is a vector quantity. It has a magnitude, 50 miles, and a direction (which happens to be 53 degrees north of west).</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 45%; margin-left: 27.5%; margin-right: 27.5%;"><img src="external/vectors/vec_displacement.png" class="contained"></div>

Velocity is a quantity that not only contains information about the speed of an object (the magnitude), velocity also gives information about the direction an object is moving. Speed does not have a "directionality" and can be fully described with just a number value. Therefore, speed is a scalar. For example, a speedometer reads a number, 60 km/hr, but gives no information about the direction of motion of the vehicle.</div></article></body>
