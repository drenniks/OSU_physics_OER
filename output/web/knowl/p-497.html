<div class="para">You now have a foundational model for how objects move, the interactions between objects that cause changes in motion, and the changes in energy and momentum that result from these interactions.  Most of physics involves applying this model to new contexts, adding to this model to account for new interactions, or building alternative models to account for situations where the existing model is insufficient.  As you encounter new situations, it can be very useful to think about what aspects of your model already apply to the new situation, what aspects definitely do not apply, and what aspects might need to change.</div>
