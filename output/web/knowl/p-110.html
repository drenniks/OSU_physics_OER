<div class="para">Consider the example from the start of this section, where you measured the length of an object in a physics lab to be 17.4 cm.  You may want to compare this number to the length of other objects that you might expect to find in a physics lab.  For example, you might expect that many objects in a physics lab can be held in one hand; you would then want to compare the 17.4 cm measurement to the size of a human hand to evaluate its reasonableness.  The search term "human hand size" results in a measurement of between 6.8 and 7.6 inches, which you might approximate to about 7 inches<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.3.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>.  Converting this 7 inches to SI units gives approximately 17.8 cm.  This is very close to the object you measured in the lab, so it seems like this measurement was pretty reasonable!  It is also worth noting here that length is usually given as a positive number, which this measurement is.</div>
