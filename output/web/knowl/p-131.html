<div class="para">The particle model is almost always useful because it is extremely simple (like many of the assumptions we will make).  However, by assuming an object is a particle, we are neglecting information about its size, extent, and rotation.  The particle model is most reasonable when these properties <em class="emphasis">do not have a substantial impact</em> on its translational motion.  Once we have a firm understanding of translational motion, we can amend our model to include other kinds of motion.  Within the particle model, we sometimes make a further assumption to consider motion only along a straight-line path (one-dimensional translational motion) rather than motion in two- or even three-dimensions.</div>
