<div class="para">Imagine you threw and caught a ball while you were sitting on a train moving at a constant velocity past a train station. To you, the ball appears to simply travel vertically up and then down under the influence of gravity. However, to an observer who stood on the station platform the ball would appear to travel in a parabola, with a constant horizontal component of velocity equal to the velocity of the train.</div>
