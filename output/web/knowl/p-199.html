<div class="para">Physically, velocity is a measure of how fast something is traveling.  In general, a faster object with travel a greater distance in the same amount of time than a slower object: you might think about a race or a car chase.  On the other hand, two objects with the same speed can travel different distances if they travel for different times, and the more time spent traveling, the farther something will travel.  The equation agrees with both becasue <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is the product of <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{.}\)</span>  If either <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> had been <em class="emphasis">divided</em> instead, we would have seen a different relationship.</div>
