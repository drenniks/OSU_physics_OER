<div class="para">Most gravitational fields you will study are created by objects that have their mass distributed with spherical symmetry, such as moons, planets, and stars.  Most such objects are, of course, not exactly spherical, but they are usually close enough that the approximation above is a very good one.  Of particular note in the expression above is the <em class="alert">direction</em> of the gravitational field: <span class="process-math">\(-\hat{r}\text{.}\)</span>  Here, <span class="process-math">\(\hat{r}\)</span> is the direction in which <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> increases, which points away from the center of the object.  Since the gravitational field is negative, it always points <em class="alert">toward</em> the center of the object creating the gravitational field.</div>
