<div class="para">While each of these skills is useful on its own, they are most powerful when used <em class="emphasis">together</em> to help you examine <dfn class="terminology">Real-world contexts</dfn>.  A Real-world Context is a situation or problem with a real setting, where you attempt to answer specific questions about a situation that could occur in the real world by making assumptions and simplifications, applying relevant aspects of your physics knowledge to determine both symbolic and numerical answers, and lastly making sense of those answers to reevaluate your understanding of the situation.  Real-world Contexts are what you will spend the vast majority of your time in physics considering.  The figure below shows all the steps involved in approaching a Real-world Context.  It seems like a lot of steps, but remember that you have already practiced each step many times already.</div>
