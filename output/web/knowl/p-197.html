<div class="para">When you use covariational reasoning, continue to follow the sensemaking steps you saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_sensemaking.html" title="Figure 2.3.3">Figure 2.3.3</a>.  In particular, you want to know both what <em class="emphasis">should</em> be true physically<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.12.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> and what the equation actually says.  As an example, consider the equation for the area of a circle in terms of its radius: <span class="process-math">\(A_{circle} = \pi r^2\text{.}\)</span>  Thinking physically first, you might think about all the various circles you have drawn or seen.  You might even draw a few circles with different radii to see how they behave.  Together, physical reasoning should tell you that increasing the radius of a circle will also lead to an increase in the area, since radius and area are both measures of the size of a circle.  Examining the equation next, <span class="process-math">\(A_{circle}\)</span> clearly <em class="emphasis">depends on</em> <span class="process-math">\(r\text{;}\)</span> in fact, increasing <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> leads to an <em class="emphasis">increase</em> in <span class="process-math">\(A_{circle}\text{.}\)</span>  In this instance, the physical reasoning and the equation agree with each other.  You can actually probably say a little more: the symbolic relationship is <em class="emphasis">quadratic</em>, so doubling <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> actually increases <span class="process-math">\(A_{circle}\)</span> by a factor of four!   This agrees with the physical behavior of a circle because changing the radius changes the size of the circle in <em class="emphasis">all</em> directions!</div>
