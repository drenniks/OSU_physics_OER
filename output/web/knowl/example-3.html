</h3> <div class="para">For a different example from the video, consider the equation <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x = v\Delta t\text{,}\)</span> rewritten from the definition of average velocity.  This equation relates <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> to two other quantities: velocity <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and time <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{.}\)</span>  We can investigate each relationship with <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> separately by holding the other quantity constant.</div> <div class="para">Physically, velocity is a measure of how fast something is traveling.  In general, a faster object with travel a greater distance in the same amount of time than a slower object: you might think about a race or a car chase.  On the other hand, two objects with the same speed can travel different distances if they travel for different times, and the more time spent traveling, the farther something will travel.  The equation agrees with both becasue <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is the product of <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{.}\)</span>  If either <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> had been <em class="emphasis">divided</em> instead, we would have seen a different relationship.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_covariation.html#example-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
