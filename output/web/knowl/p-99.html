<dfn class="terminology">Time:</dfn> Throughout most of history, the standard of time was based on the mean solar day. However, scientists needed a way to make incredibly high precision measurements of time and so physicists began developing a device called an atomic clock. Atomic clocks work on the principle that subatomic particles called electrons will move back and forth between different energy states when exposed to certain frequencies of radiation. The United Statesâ€™ standard atomic clock is said to be so accurate that in 30 million years it would neither gain nor lose a second. One second is defined as the time it takes for 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a radio wave absorbed by the cesium-133 atom.</div>
