  "body": " Introduction to Vectors   MIT vectors vs. scalars.   A mathematical object which has a both a magnitude (a size or amount) and a direction is called a vector . It is essential to take into account how both the magnitude and direction of a vector quantity changes when you analyze motion. A quantity that only has a magnitude is called a scalar .  In diagrams, vectors are represented by arrows. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector and the arrowhead indicates the direction of the vector. Symbolically, you will draw an arrow on top of a symbol to denote a vector quantity.  Suppose you have a vector . The negative vector has the same magnitude as vector , but points in the opposite direction. Once you understand how to visually represent and perform operations on vectors, you will move on to understand how to manipulate them algebraically.   A representation of vectors as arrows showing a vector and also the negative of that vector.     How are vectors related to motion?  Suppose that you drive North for 40 miles and then head West for 30 miles. You have now driven a total of 70 miles, yet your total displacement is only 50 miles Northwest from where you started. Displacement is a vector quantity. It has a magnitude, 50 miles, and a direction (which happens to be 53 degrees north of west).   The displacement vector for an object that moves North 40 km and then West 30 km.    Another, common example of a vector is velocity . Velocity is a quantity that not only contains information about the speed of an object (the magnitude), velocity also gives information about the direction an object is moving. Speed does not have a \"directionality\" and can be fully described with just a number value. Therefore, speed is a scalar. For example, a speedometer reads a number, 60 km\/hr, but gives no information about the direction of motion of the vehicle.    Activities  Explore Vectors and Scalars  Make a list of physical quantities you are familiar with from your everyday experience. For each quantity, do you think it would be better to represent it as a scalar or as a vector ?   Magnitude  A vector is typically represented graphically by an arrow. Which property of the arrow do you think represents the magnitude of the vector? How would you represent two vectors that have the same direction but different magnitudes?

Does the meaning depend on whether you are in the car for longer or shorter than one hour?   You can find many different definitions for the subject of physics. One way to define physics is by listing the aspects of the real world that physics aims to describe. Such aspects typically include motion, forces, and energy, along with many other topics that may or may not fall within those three terms. You will start by studying motion : the movement of one or more objects through space.   Mechanics  The study of the motion is sometimes called mechanics. Mechanics is an expansive name that itself includes many related ideas, including forces, energy, and momentum. You will study two branches of mechanics: first, you will study how objects move through space (sometimes called kinematics); then you will study why objects move (sometimes called dynamics).   Another way to define physics is as a collection of practices. Physics is a systematic way of looking at the world that involves building quantitative models and mechanistic explanations for why real-world objects and systems behave the way they do. Eventually, such models and explanations will be rich and detailed, including one or more systems, assumptions or idealizations, graphs or diagrams, laws and equations, and calculations or estimates. You will start with a core idea that will inform your future work: how to construct an explanation .   Steps to follow when giving an explanation.   Explanations in Physics. 1. Principles – what fundamental physics concepts, laws, or definitions did you start with? 2. Reasoning – explain all the reasoning steps to go from your starting point to your conclusion. 3. Conclusion – state your conclusion clearly.    Explanation Activity   An example of how you might talk about motion in your everyday life is the expression \"`distance equals rate times time.\"' Use this as a fundamental concept to practice constructing an explanation for the context below.  You and a friend are driving in separate cars from the city of Corvallis to its neighboring city of Albany. You travel at a speed that is just under the speed limit, while your friend travels at a speed that is just over the speed limit. Which of you arrives in Albany first.  Sometimes you need to make additional assumptions in order to answer a question. What assumptions might be important here? Your friend arrives first! In addition to \"`distance equals rate times time,\"' try these two assumptions: that the distance traveled is the same (both drivers take the same route) and that the drivers leave at the same time. Since the product of speed (rate) and time must be a constant (the distance driven), the driver with the larger speed must complete the drive in the smaller time. Your friend is the driver with the higher speed, so they must take less time, arriving before you!   "

  "title": "Numbers and Units",
  "body": " Numbers and Units  The measurement of any quantity is reported as a number in terms of some standard, physical unit. For example, you might measure the length of an object in a physics lab to be 17.4. Without a specific unit of measurement, the number itself is almost meaningless. You might mean the length is 17.4 centimeters, 17.4 inches, or 17.4 miles.  In science, we use the SI unit system (le Systéme Internationale d'Unités), commonly referred to as the metric system In the united States, we have an entire government agency dedicated to upholding standards of measurement . Within the metric system, all quantities will be given in terms of base units, such as the three below, which are typically written using non-italic letters prefixes can be used as an easy way to express units that are substantially different .   Base units and derived units  Units for physical quantities can be divided into two categories: base units and derived units. Examples of derived units, which are often given their own name, include force (the Newton) and energy (the Joule), each of which is a specific combination of the base units of length, time and mass.    Time: The SI unit of time is the second. The abbreviation for the second is the lower case letter s.   Length: The SI unit of length is the meter. The abbreviation for the meter is the lower case m.   Mass: The unit of mass is the kilogram. The abbreviation for the meter is lower case kg.    Time: Throughout most of history, the standard of time was based on the mean solar day. However, scientists needed a way to make incredibly high precision measurements of time and so physicists began developing a device called an atomic clock. Atomic clocks work on the principle that subatomic particles called electrons will move back and forth between different energy states when exposed to certain frequencies of radiation. The United States' standard atomic clock is said to be so accurate that in 30 million years it would neither gain nor lose a second. One second is defined as the time it takes for 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a radio wave absorbed by the cesium-133 atom.   Length: One meter is the distance light can travel in a vacuum during 1\/299,792,458 of a second.   Mass: For many years, one kilogram was the mass of a polished platinum-iridium cylinder, the international standard kilogram, which is stored in Paris, France. Since 2019, the kilogram has been defined even more precisely using the above definitions for length and time along with a fundamental quantum mechanical property of the universe called Planck's constant.   An image of the kilogram standard held in Paris, France.   A small cylindrical object inside a glass container.    Checking units or numbers are two of the easiest and most powerful ways to make sense of something in physics. When you make sense of something, your objective is evaluate whether or not what physics says about a context aligns with your physical understanding and reasoning about that context. The steps below will help give you a process to follow for physics sensemaking.   Steps to follow when sensemaking.   Physics Sensemaking. 1. Choose a sensemaking strategy. 2a. What should this strategy say about the context? 2b. Give a physical reason for why it says this. 3a. What does your answer actually say? 3b. Show what it says explicitly. 4. Compare what your answer actually says and what it should say!    Check Units   For any equation, including at any point while you are solving a problem, you should be able to check the units to make sure the units accurately describe all relevant quantities.      How to Check Units   Dimensions  Sometimes, the physics will use the word dimensions to refer to the class of unit for a quantity. For example, speed can be measured in units of km\/hr, m\/s, or mi\/hr but the base dimensions , represented in square brackets, are always a length [L] divided by a time [T].   Suppose that we have derived the escape speed of a rocket from a planet of mass and radius (escape speed is the speed at which an object must reach to escape the gravitational pull): . As a speed, should have units like m\/s (distance divided by time).  Here, represents the universal gravitational constant with units . Since there is an equal sign, this implies that the base units of either side of the equal sign must be the same. If they are not, then we have made a mistake in our derivation of the escape speed. We can perform a unit analysis to determine if we have the same base units for each side of the equal sign.     We can see that the physical quantities under the square root indeed have base units of [L] divided by a time [T] and so our equation holds true. Observe that we followed the sensemaking steps outlined above: we chose a strategy (checking units), determined what units we should get, found the units we actually have, and compared the two to see that they are the same!    Check Numbers   For any numerical value (with units), you want to have a sense for how reasonable the value is given numerical values for other (possibly related) contexts with the same units. You also want to know whether the number should be positive or negative (if it is a scalar) or what direction it should point (if it is a vector).     How to Check Numbers  Consider the example from the start of this section, where you measured the length of an object in a physics lab to be 17.4 cm. You may want to compare this number to the length of other objects that you might expect to find in a physics lab. For example, you might expect that many objects in a physics lab can be held in one hand; you would then want to compare the 17.4 cm measurement to the size of a human hand to evaluate its reasonableness. The search term \"human hand size\" results in a measurement of between 6.8 and 7.6 inches, which you might approximate to about 7 inches when checking numbers, you do not need to be precise, just approximate . Converting this 7 inches to SI units gives approximately 17.8 cm. This is very close to the object you measured in the lab, so it seems like this measurement was pretty reasonable! It is also worth noting here that length is usually given as a positive number, which this measurement is.  You might be asking yourself: what would an unreasonable answer have looked like? Perhaps your measurement had been 174 cm instead of 17.4 cm. This is only about ten times bigger, and still seems like a reasonable measurement for a physics lab (something about the height of a person). On the other hand, measuring something like 17.4 km would be fairly unreasonable for an ordinary physics lab: 100,000 times bigger than a person's hand!    Units Activities  Practice Identifying Units Below is a list of symbols we commonly use in physics to represent physical quantities. For each symbol, indicate the units you would expect for the corresponding quantity.  (time)  (distance)  (mass)  (final time)  (position)  (area)   Practice Checking Units  Your friend has developed a new engine that creates carbon dioxide gas. Your friend shows you an equation they created relating the volume of gas created ( ) to the width of the engine ( ), the amount of time the engine has been running ( ), and the mass of a single molecule of carbon dioxide ( ): . Use what you know about the other symbols in the problem to determine the units of .     Practice Identifying an Error with Units While looking through a mathematics textbook, you come across the following equation for the surface area of a cylinder: . You suspect this equation must have a mistake in it. How can you use units to tell what the mistake is? How could you use units to fix the mistake?    Numbers Exercises  Practice Identifying Numbers Below is a list of numbers with units. For each number, find a real-world object or system with a measurement that is reasonably close is the symbol for the prefix micro-; you can search for how big it is .  900,000 kg    110 m  60 mg  0.3 s   Practice Checking Numbers and Identifying Errors Imagine that you came upon the following numbers while reading an article. Try to identify whether or not each number is reasonable without directly looking up the quantity in question.  It takes light around 8.5 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun  A semitruck was declared to be overloaded at a mass of 5000 kg  The distance from the Earth to the Moon is m.  The mass of a pea is 0.2 g  An Olympic marathon is 42 km  An Orca can hold its breath underwater for 10,000 s    "

  "body": " The Particle Model  In physics, you will often decide to make assumptions or idealizations. When you do, you should always consider the three questions below.   Questions to ask when you make an assumption.   Assumptions and Idealizations. 1 Is the assumption useful for the context? 2 Is the assumption reasonable for the context? 3 Are there any limitations for the context?    Introducing the particle model, an example of an assumption in physics.    The motion of real objects is often extremely complicated. For example, when you toss a coin, it will likely rotate so that different parts of the coin move at different speeds, and in different directions.  To begin to investigate motion, we will make a simplifying assumption that an object in motion can be treated as a particle . When we make this assumption, we say that we are using the particle model because we are modeling the motion of an object as if it were a particle .   The Particle Model   When you assume that a system can be treated as a point particle , you treat it as only undergoing translational motion (motion without rotation). Under this assumption, you treat all the mass of the system as existing at the object's center of mass center of mass is a property we will not need until we begin studying rotational motion .     When does an assumption fail?  When you encounter a new assumption, you might want to consider not just when it is good to make the assumption, but instead when the assumption might fail. As an assumption, the particle model tends to fail when there is (important) rotational motion or when your system has multiple pieces that are moving differently. For example, sliding a spinning top may not be a good example for the particle model, as the translational motion is deeply tied with both the top’s shape and rotation.    The particle model is almost always useful because it is extremely simple (like many of the assumptions we will make). However, by assuming an object is a particle, we are neglecting information about its size, extent, and rotation. The particle model is most reasonable when these properties do not have a substantial impact on its translational motion. Once we have a firm understanding of translational motion, we can amend our model to include other kinds of motion. Within the particle model, we sometimes make a further assumption to consider motion only along a straight-line path (one-dimensional translational motion) rather than motion in two- or even three-dimensions.   Activities: Applying the Particle Model  For each of the following contexts, do you think it is reasonable to use the particle model? Why or why not? What object or system are you treating as a particle?  You drive your car from Corvallis to Portland.  You throw a softball from one base to another.  You slowly open a heavy door.  An Olympic athlete does a flip while snowboarding.  Two snowballs break into pieces as they collide in midair.   "

Where velocity is a vector, indicating both magnitude and direction, the word speed refers only to the magnitude of the velocity.

  "body": " Representing Acceleration  An example of representing acceleration.  In previous sections, you learned about two important motion representations: motion diagrams and motion graphs . Either of these representations can feature acceleration as well as velocity and position.  A motion diagram can be extended to include acceleration by sketching and labeling acceleration vectors for each point using the definition for acceleration.  A motion graph for acceleration is also pretty straightforward: simply graph acceleration on the vertical axis vs. time on the horizontal axis! When you make motion graphs, you usually want to graph all three quantities: position, velocity, and acceleration. When you are just starting out, making each graph on its own set of axes is very helpful, but professional physicists sometimes graph all three on the same set of axes! Once you have all three graphs, you can then leverage your calculus understanding to confirm the relationship between them. For example, since acceleration is the derivative of velocity, the graph of acceleration vs. time should match the slope of the graph of velocity vs. time!   Activities: Representing Acceleration  Recall .   Complete the motion diagram for the ball by sketching acceleration vectors at each point. (Your vectors should be at qualitatively accurate! That is, vectors with larger magnitudes should have greater length.)   Sketch a motion graph for the ball showing acceleration vs. time.

  "title": "Covariational Sensemaking",
  "body": " Covariational Sensemaking  You have previously learned how to make sense of both units and numbers in . Perhaps the most powerful type of physics sensemaking is symbolic , since so much of physics is concerned with symbolic equations. The most general way to make sense of a symbolic equation is with covariational reasoning.   Covariational Reasoning   Covariational Reasoning , or Covariation , involves examining the relationship between two (or more) quantities to see how they are changing together \"co\" meaning together and \"variation\" meaning changing . The objective is to state how the quantities are related and why that relationship makes sense.    When you use covariational reasoning, continue to follow the sensemaking steps you saw in . In particular, you want to know both what should be true physically often, drawing a diagram or a graph can help your physical reasoning and what the equation actually says. As an example, consider the equation for the area of a circle in terms of its radius: . Thinking physically first, you might think about all the various circles you have drawn or seen. You might even draw a few circles with different radii to see how they behave. Together, physical reasoning should tell you that increasing the radius of a circle will also lead to an increase in the area, since radius and area are both measures of the size of a circle. Examining the equation next, clearly depends on  ; in fact, increasing leads to an increase in . In this instance, the physical reasoning and the equation agree with each other. You can actually probably say a little more: the symbolic relationship is quadratic , so doubling actually increases by a factor of four! This agrees with the physical behavior of a circle because changing the radius changes the size of the circle in all directions!  An example of using Covariational Reasoning.   How to Use Covariational Reasoning  For a different example from the video, consider the equation , rewritten from the definition of average velocity. This equation relates to two other quantities: velocity and time . We can investigate each relationship with separately by holding the other quantity constant.  Physically, velocity is a measure of how fast something is traveling. In general, a faster object with travel a greater distance in the same amount of time than a slower object: you might think about a race or a car chase. On the other hand, two objects with the same speed can travel different distances if they travel for different times, and the more time spent traveling, the farther something will travel. The equation agrees with both becasue is the product of and . If either or had been divided instead, we would have seen a different relationship.    Activities: Practice Sensemaking  The statements below are incorrect. For each statement, use a sensemaking strategy to determine why it is incorrect, such as the one introduced in this section or those in .  Your friend has built a rocket and reports that it has a top speed of .  The Wizard of Oz claims the volume of his balloon is related to the temperature by a constant : .

Below is another example: if you know an object's acceleration as a function of time and you want to find the change in velocity between some initial and final time.  Chop: You can start by chopping up a time interval into small pieces. Each piece of time is represented by the expression , where the indicates that the actual amount of time is infinitesimally small .  Multiply: You want to know about velocity, but you know about acceleration. Although you want , the change in velocity over a whole time interval, you can start by trying to find an infinitesimal change in velocity . By rewriting the definition of instantaneous acceleration as , you can see that a way to get is to multiply  and .

The Mythbusters test relative motion.   Activities   You are running down a straight track at a speed of 8 m\/s (relative to the track). Two friends, one in front of you and one behind, each throw a baseball horizontally toward you at a speed of 24 m\/s (relative to the track). Relative to you , which baseball, if either, has a greater speed? Explain your reasoning.   Relative motion problems can be tricky to visualize, so it often helps to draw a diagram!    You are running down a straight track at a speed of 8 m\/s (relative to the track). Two friends, one in front of you and one behind, each throw a baseball horizontally toward you. Relative to you, each baseball has a speed of 24 m\/s. Relative to the track , which baseball has a greater speed? Explain your reasoning.    Any measurement of position or velocity needs to be made with respect to a specific frame of reference. Suppose a person is walking past you at 5 km\/hr toward the front of an airplane which is traveling west at 150 km\/hr. The speed of 5 km\/hr is with respect to the plane's frame of reference. With respect to the ground, this person is actually moving at speed (150 km\/hr + 5 km\/hr = 155 km\/hr). Just as it is always important to specify the units of a quantity when reporting a number, it is equally important to specify the frame of reference from which you are making a measurement.  Imagine you threw and caught a ball while you were sitting on a train moving at a constant velocity past a train station. To you, the ball appears to simply travel vertically up and then down under the influence of gravity. However, to an observer who stood on the station platform the ball would appear to travel in a parabola, with a constant horizontal component of velocity equal to the velocity of the train.   The different observations occur because the two observers are in different frames of reference . A frame of reference is a set of coordinates that can be used to determine positions and velocities of objects in that frame; different frames of reference move relative to one another. Specifically, an inertial frame is one that is not accelerating.  The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames (this is known as Galilean invariance). Put in another way, there is no experiment that you could do to determine which reference frame you are in (Einstein used this hypothesis to devise the theory of Special Relativity). This means that we can address problems in any reference frame to give an equivalent solution, but we must specify the coordinate system (frame of reference) we are using whenever we are solving a problem in physics.

  "body": " What are Forces?  Introductory Activity: Start by writing a short (2-3 sentence) description of how you use the term force in your everyday life. You might want to include an example.  An introduction to forces.   Simply stated, a force is something that pushes or pulls an object. Isaac Newton originated the concept of forces, encapsulating the theory in terms of three laws, known as Newton's laws. Force is a vector. It has a magnitude and a direction. In the simplest terms, you can think of a force as a push or a pull. An object can have more than one force acting on it. If we add up all of the forces acting on an object, we call this the net force. It can be a tricky business, since the forces can be acting in different directions. An object can have two forces acting on it and still have a net force of zero if the two forces are acting in different directions and have the same magnitude.   Force   A force is an interaction between two objects (or systems) that causes those objects to experience a push or pull. Every force is a vector that has a type and involves two distinct objects acting on each other.     Activities: Explore forces  Use the video below to answer the exploration questions.   Dr. Paws gets a ball.     Identify and describe the different types of forces you believe are acting on Dr. Paws in the video above as she chases the ball.  Write a short (2-3 sentence) description of how we use the term force in physics . Highlight any differences between your physics description and your personal description from the first exercise.  Brainstorm a list of possible different types of forces you can imagine acting on something.  The SI unit for a force is the Newton, which is not commonly used in everyday. The Imperial unit for force is the pound . Use a search to find the number of Newtons in one pound. An amateur soccer player might be able to kick a soccer ball with a force of around 500-700 pounds.

  "title": "Free-body Diagrams",
  "body": " Free-body Diagrams  An introduction to free-body diagrams.   System   A system is an object or collection of objects considered as a single group. Everything in a context can be considered as either internal or external to a system.    Systems are crucial to understanding how to apply physics models. Often, how you decide to group objects into systems is a matter of convenience, but your choice of what is internal to a system will impact what forces you will consider to be important.   Free-body Diagram    A Free-body Diagram is a pictorial way to represent the forces acting on an object. In a free-body diagram , each force should be labeled using the following symbol , where indicates that the symbol represents a force, the superscript represents the type of force (for example, for gravity), represents the system on which the force is acted, and represents the system that is exerting the force.     Alternate Notations  Some physicists prefer to use alternate notation for forces. For example, you might decide to reverse the subscripts to say the force by on . Or, you might decide to use an expression like for a normal force. Any of these notations are useful, as long as (1) the notation indicates the type of force and the systems involved and (2) the notation is consistent across different forces.   One of the most important things to understand when drawing free-body diagrams is the difference between forces acting on a system (which appear on that system's free-body diagram) and forces acted by a system, which would instead be represented on the free-body diagram for the other system. It is also important not to include things that are not forces, such as the velocity or acceleration of the system, which would instead be represented using a motion diagram. It is also helpful to include the force vectors acting on a system with relatively correct lengths as well as coordinate axes and any relevant angles.   Activities: Practice with Free-body Diagrams  Choose an instant in the video of Dr. Paws from and use what you learned above to draw a free-body diagram for the system consisting only of the dog.  The free-body diagram is one of the representational tools you will use most often throughout physics. Why do you think it might be such a valuable too? What features of the free body diagram do you think might be most helpful when you are solving future problems?   "

  "body": " The Law of Inertia (Newton's First Law)  An introduction to Newton's 1st Law.    The Law of Inertia  An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force.    Aristotelian Motion  Before Newton's Laws of Motion, a prevailing theory of motion was put forth by Aristotle: that the natural state of an object was to be at rest as close as possible to the center of the universe (which was, of course, the center of the Earth), and that if an object was disturbed, it would move and then return to rest.  In contrast, the Law of Inertia states something fundamental about the behavior of objects: that an object has two possible natural states: at rest or moving in a straight line at constant speed.   The term inertia—more commonly referred to as mass —is the capacity of an object to resist any change to its motion. The more mass something has, the more net external force it is going to take to change the object's motion.   Mass   The mass of an object, typically represented by , is the capacity of that object to resist changes to its motion as you will see in the next section, mass can be operationally defined as the amount of net force per acceleration required to speed up or slow down the object .

Most forces you will encounter in your study of everyday physics are contact forces, including the list below.    A normal force is a force between two objects that acts perpendicular to the surface of contact between them. the word normal here is used in a mathematical sense that means perpendicular Normal forces always push away from the surface of contact. There is no model for the magnitude of a normal force: if you do not know the magnitude of a normal force from some external source, you can probably determine it by exploring the context.  A friction force is a force between two objects that acts parallel to the surface of contact between them, in contrast to the normal force above. You will learn more about the force of friction starting in .  A tension force is a force between a rope or a string and another system. Tension forces always pull along the direction of the rope or string at the surface of contact. You will learn more about the force of tension in .

The gravitational force uses a form that is common in physics: a product of a property of the system feeling the force (here, mass ) and a property of the system exerting the force (here, gravitational field ). This aligns with the general model for forces, which always involves two systems! Interestingly, gravity is a non-contact force : it will act on a system even if no other system is in contact with it.   Activities  Summarize What You Learned - Gravitational Field At the end of the video, you are asked to think about what kind of quantity the gravitational field is.

A pulley is usually a small, grooved cylinder that is used to change the direction of a rope or string. Using a pulley breaks one of the assumptions we made about ideal ropes, because the pulley can act a force on the middle of the rope. Fortunately, we can make a further assumption to neglect the impact of the pulley.   Ideal Pulley   An ideal pulley is frictionless, massless, and does not accelerate, in which case it will apply no force on the rope and thus allow you to assume that the rope is ideal (if it meets all other necessary criteria).    The video below shows an example problem being solved using an ideal pulley. You should watch the entire video before attempting the exercises below.  An example problem involving a pulley.

  "title": "What is Energy?",
  "body": " What is Energy?  Introductory Activity: Start by writing 2-4 things you already know about energy, each as a single complete sentence.   An introduction to energy.  Like many words used in physics, you probably use the word \"energy\" in your everyday life. For example, you likely know what it feels like to have \"a lot of energy\" or you might talk about being \"low on energy.\" Colloquially, energy can be thought of as the capacity to do something. The physics definition of energy will try to take this idea and make it more specific and quantifiable.   Energy   The Energy of a system is a physical property measuring its ability to exert forces that can impact the displacement of other systems. Energy is a scalar quantity measured in Joules (J).     Forms of Energy   Energy comes in many types known as forms . The primary forms you will encounter in physics are kinetic energy (energy associated with motion, including translational, rotational, and thermal kinetic energy) and potential energy (including gravitational, electrical, chemical, and nuclear potential energy). Within a system, energy can transform from one form to another form. You can add together all the different forms of energy in a system to get that system's total energy , usually symbolized by or just .   Energy Transfer   Energy can be transferred from one system to another when those two systems interact with each other in certain ways. When energy is transferred from one system to another, the total energy of one system will increase and the total energy of the other system will decrease by the same amount. The primary means of energy transfer in physics are work (energy transfer associated with a force) and heat (energy transfer associated with a difference in temperature). If a system is not interacting with anything external (or if all external energy transfers sum to zero), you can say that the total energy of the system is conserved , or constant in time. If you were to choose a system consisting of everything in the universe, since there is nothing external to interact with the universe, you can say that the total energy in the universe should be conserved.   Conservation  Conservation laws are powerful natural laws which describe which processes simply can or cannot occur. Energy becomes especially valuable when you have systems of many objects interacting where a detailed consideration of all the forces may be difficult or impossible.    Origins of Energy as a Concept  Historically, Aristotle of Stagira (384–322 BCE) in ancient Greece was the first known writer to use the word energeia (ενεργεια) in his text Nicomachean Ethics. Energeia literally means \"in work\" or \"to contain work\". In physics, energy is often defined as the ability to do work .    Energy Activities  Sensemaking: Type of Quantity  In contrast to the many vector quantities you have studied, energy is a scalar quantity. What is the primary difference between a vector quantity and a scalar quantity?   A vector quantity has both a magnitude and a direction, and can be represented by an arrow in space. A scalar quantity is represented only by a single number, and so it does not have a direction, although that number can be positive, negative, or zero.   Exploration: Energy Forms for a Skier Just before you start skiing down a mountain, your system starts with a large amount of gravitational potential energy. As you ski down the mountain, your system's gravitational potential energy decreases , transforming into other forms. What other forms of your system's energy do you think are changing as you ski down the mountain? Are they increasing or decreasing? Do you expect any forms of energy to change in more than one way?  Practice: Energy Transfer Suppose you have three systems: A, B, and C. Each system begins with a total energy of 50 J. The systems then interact so that system A transfers 20 J to system B and system B transfers 35 J to system C. Find the total energy of each system after the energy transfers.  Sensemaking: Unit Conversion Another common unit for energy is the kilocalorie (known colloquially as the Calorie). Look up the number of Joules in a kilocalorie. How many Joules are in a typical 2000 Calorie daily diet?   "

The Work-Energy Theorem   The net work done by external forces on an object or system is equal to the change in total energy of that system: .    The Work-Energy Theorem is one of the most fundamental laws in physics. In fact, it is used throughout essentially all of science. It says something simple but profound: if you want to change the energy of a system, something external has to interact with the system. In most of physics, the kind of interaction that can transfer energy to a system is work.   No Heat Transfer  The Work-Energy Theorem assumes that no heat is transferred into or out of the system of interest. If heat is transferred, you can use the First Law of Thermodynamics instead of the Work-Energy Theorem: , where is the net heat transferred to the system.    Activities   How do you think you would find the net work if more than one thing is doing work on your system? Write an equation corresponding to your thinking.     Explanation: Changing Energies  Suppose you have a system that initially includes some kinetic energy and some potential energy. You observe that the potential energy decreases by 7000 J and the kinetic energy increases by 4500 J. Is the net external work on this system positive, negative, or zero? Explain your reasoning.

When you make the Particle Model (that is, no rotational motion), all kinetic energy is translational, and it is often simply called kinetic energy and written .    Kinetic energy is the energy of motion . Most kinetic energy you will work with is translational. Objects that are rotating (which you will study later) have rotational kinetic energy , possibly in addition to translational kinetic energy.   Thermal Energy  Thermal energy is a unique form of kinetic energy related to the internal motion of the individual molecules that make up an object or substance. An object's thermal energy is related to its temperature: as an object grows warmer, it has more thermal energy. Internally, energy can transform from other forms into thermal energy, usually when there is a dissipative internal force like friction or air resistance. Externally, thermal energy can be transferred from one system to a colder object as heat .    Kinetic Energy Activities  Summarize What You Learned - Kinetic Energy Write a 1-2 sentence description of what the definition of kinetic energy says in words and why it makes sense given your everyday experience.

  "body": " Applying Physics Models  You now have a foundational model for how objects move, the interactions between objects that cause changes in motion, and the changes in energy and momentum that result from these interactions. Most of physics involves applying this model to new contexts, adding to this model to account for new interactions, or building alternative models to account for situations where the existing model is insufficient. As you encounter new situations, it can be very useful to think about what aspects of your model already apply to the new situation, what aspects definitely do not apply, and what aspects might need to change.   Introductory Activities  Summarize Your Model Take this opportunity to synthesize and summarize the model you have already built in a way that makes sense to you. Such a synthesis is often most useful when you use multiple representations (such as words, equations, and graphs or diagrams) to highlight key concepts and connections between key concepts.  The questions below will introduce you to the first new situation in which you will be applying your physics models.  Exploration - Curved Road  Suppose you are in the right seat of a car driving along a curved road. Use everyday language to explain what happens as the car is turning to the left along a curved road. In particular:   What direction do you move relative to the car?  What direction do you move relative to the ground?  What do you feel as the car turns?    Prediction - Car Turning A car moves counterclockwise at constant speed along the curved road shown below.

  "body": " Simple Harmonic Motion  A mathematical object which has a both a magnitude (a size or amount) and a direction is called a vector . It is essential to take into account how both the magnitude and direction of a vector quantity changes when you analyze motion. A quantity that only has a magnitude is called a scalar . Suppose you have a vector . The negative vector has the same magnitude as vector , but points in the opposite direction. Once you understand how to visually represent and perform operations on vectors, you will move on to understand how to manipulate them algebraically.   A representation of vectors as arrows showing a vector and also the negative of that vector.     How are vectors related to motion?  Suppose that you drive North for 40 miles and then head West for 30 miles. You have now driven a total of 70 miles, yet your total displacement is only 50 miles Northwest from where you started. Displacement is a vector quantity. It has a magnitude, 50 miles, and a direction (which happens to be 53 degrees north of west).   The displacement vector for an object that moves North 40 km and then West 30 km.    Another, common example of a vector is velocity . Velocity is a quantity that not only contains information about the speed of an object (the magnitude), velocity also gives information about the direction an object is moving. Speed does not have a \"directionality\" and can be fully described with just a number value. Therefore, speed is a scalar. For example, a speedometer reads a number, 60 km\/hr, but gives no information about the direction of motion of the vehicle.    Activities  Explore Vectors and Scalars  Make a list of physical quantities you are familiar with from your everyday experience. For each quantity, do you think it would be better to represent it as a scalar or as a vector ?   Magnitude  A vector is typically represented graphically by an arrow. Which property of the arrow do you think represents the magnitude of the vector? How would you represent two vectors that have the same direction but different magnitudes?

  "body": " How are vectors related to motion?  Suppose that you drive North for 40 miles and then head West for 30 miles. You have now driven a total of 70 miles, yet your total displacement is only 50 miles Northwest from where you started. Displacement is a vector quantity. It has a magnitude, 50 miles, and a direction (which happens to be 53 degrees north of west).   The displacement vector for an object that moves North 40 km and then West 30 km.    Another, common example of a vector is velocity . Velocity is a quantity that not only contains information about the speed of an object (the magnitude), velocity also gives information about the direction an object is moving. Speed does not have a \"directionality\" and can be fully described with just a number value. Therefore, speed is a scalar. For example, a speedometer reads a number, 60 km\/hr, but gives no information about the direction of motion of the vehicle.  "
