Modern pedagogies for teaching physics require new curricular resources that go beyond what is offered by traditional textbooks. We will replace the required publisherâ€™s textbook for calculus-based introductory physics with open-source, free-to-student text. We plan to survey existing resources and adopt those that best address our learning objectives via interactive learning, make the most use of modern technologies, and directly promote the inclusion of underrepresented populations. We will continuously monitor the implementation of these resources by checking directly with students to see that their needs are being met and by comparing student performance to longstanding baselines.
